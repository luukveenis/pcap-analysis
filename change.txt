Changes since the in-lab demo:

When doing my demo, a number of things had not yet been implemented. What I've
added since is listed below:

1) Added reporting for min/mean/max durations for complete connections

2) Added reporting for data bytes send from the client to the server and
   vice versa; as well as the total bytes sent.

3) Added counts for reset, complete, and open connections

4) Added reporting for start and end times for connections

5) Added reporting for number of packets sent between client and server

6) Added reporting for min/mean/max window sizes

7) Added computation for RTTs
